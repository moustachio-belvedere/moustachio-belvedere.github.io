        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
           This site is a portfolio website written for the Coursera course 
           <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-design-project">Web 
           Design for Everybody Capstone</a>. It is intended to be responsive
           and accessible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           The <a href="imgs.html">Image Showcase</a> page features a responsive
           image gallery with a selection of images from Wikipedia. The <a href=
           "d3.html">Javascript Showcase</a> features an interactive SVG canvas 
           developed using the Javscript library <a href="https://d3js.org/">
           D3.js</a>. The <a href="webgl.html">WebGL Showcase</a> is a simple version
           of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"> 
           Conway's Game of Life</a> rendered on your graphics card using <a href=
           "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a>.
           Lastly, the <a href="credits.html">Licensing Credits</a> is a listing
           of all external code/images used in this website and their associated
           licensing information.

        <h1>Page Requirements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Must have at least three "pages." These can can be three different 
                html files, or one file that links to all three "pages".
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page must validate at validator.w3.org.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least two unique views.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must have at least 4 images on one of your pages. (If this requirement
                doesn't "fit" your portfolio plan, please just make an extra page that 
                fulfills it. You can always unlink it after you have been peer -graded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page must be styled. The goal is not to impress, but to show competence.
                So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules. But peer-review
                with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <details>
            <summary>Does the site validate?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>10pts – Fully validates (warnings are fine).</li>
                <li>8 pts – There are errors, but the student has shown (in their write-up
                    or video) that they are caused by plugins and can not be fixed.</li>
                <li>6 pts – There are at most 3 errors for the entire site.</li>
                <li>3pts – They have only shown that part of the site validates. 
                    (For instance, only tested one of the files in a multi-file site.)</li>
                <li>0 pts – More than three errors were left or the site was not tested at all.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Is the site responsive?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>20pts – Yes, the site has a unique look/layout for each of the views.</li>
                <li>10pts – The site has a unique look, but not a unique layout. (For example, 
                    they changed only colors of fonts, not the actual layout.) </li>
                <li>6pts – Only some of the pages are responsive - not all of them.</li>
                <li>0pts – The site is not responsive.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Is the site well-styled?</summary>
            <p>This is very subjective. It should be difficult to score a high score,
            but not difficult to receive the majority of the points. It is
            important that everyone create a unique style sheet, even if using a
            template or framework. Look for feedback in Week Five to improve your
            score.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10pts – The site is incredibly well-styled and the author went
                beyond the required (animation, hovering, etc done with CSS).</li>
                <li>8pts – The site is very well-styled. The content has a layout that
                is easy to follow and a variety of colors and fonts were used. --
                Most students can expect to receive this score.</li>
                <li>4pts – The styling is lacking or the author relied almost
                exclusively on a template/framework.</li>
                <li>0pts – Less than 9 unique CSS rules were used.</li>
            </ul>
